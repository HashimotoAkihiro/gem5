\subsection{説明}
\hyperlink{classPortProxy}{PortProxy} Object Declaration.

\hyperlink{classPort}{Port} proxies are used when non-\/structural entities need access to the memory system (or structural entities that want to peak into the memory system without making a real memory access).

Proxy objects replace the previous FunctionalPort, TranslatingPort and VirtualPort objects, which provided the same functionality as the proxies, but were instances of ports not corresponding to real structural ports of the simulated system. Via the port proxies all the accesses go through an actual port (either the system port, e.g. for processes or initialisation, or a the data port of the CPU, e.g. for threads) and thus are transparent to a potentially distributed memory and automatically adhere to the memory map of the system.
